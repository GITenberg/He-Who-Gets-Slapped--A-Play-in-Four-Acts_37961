description: Paul Beaumont is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his
  radical theories on the origin of mankind. Baron Regnard becomes his patron, enabling
  him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his
  beloved wife Marie and the baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready
  to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to
  the baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the
  safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron. It is clear that Marie
  and the baron are lovers. On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with
  the baron. He is aghast when the baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit
  for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in
  front of everyone, but the baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and
  slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort
  from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and
  calls him a clown. Paul leaves them. Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling
  himself "He who gets slapped", the star attraction of a small circus near Paris.
  His act consists of him getting slapped every evening by other clowns. - Wikipedia.
